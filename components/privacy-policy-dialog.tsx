          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">Deleting, Modifying And Updating Your Information</h3>
          <p>
            At your request, we will: (a) inform you of what personal information we have on file for you; (b) amend the
            personal information that we have on file for you; and/or (c) remove personal information that you have
            provided to us, or that we have collected. You may do so by e-mailing us at: office@prime-lawgroup.com. We
            ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
            removed before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to
            process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort,
            jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
            information residing on backup tapes).
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be advised that deleting your personal information may terminate your access to certain of the Sites
            Offerings. If you wish to continue using the full complement of Sites Offerings, you may not be able to
            delete all of the personal information that we have on file for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be further advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a
            period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">Transfer Of Personal Information Internationally</h3>

            If you are visiting the Sites from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your
            communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By
            visiting the Sites and/or otherwise communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers.
            Even if your jurisdiction does not have the same privacy laws as the jurisdiction where our servers are
            located, we will treat your information as subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a notice on the Sites
            that we are changing our Privacy Policy. If the manner in which we use personal information changes, We will
            notify Users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our Users via email; and/or (b) by any other reasonable
            means acceptable under applicable state and federal law. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use
            your information in this different manner and we will only use your information in this different manner
            where you opt-in to such use.
